## Available Settings

* Allow navigation through all files that contains bookmarks (`false` by default)
```
    "bookmarks.navigateThroughAllFiles": true
```

* Bookmarks are always saved between sessions, and you can decide if it should be saved _in the Project_, so you can add it to your Git/SVN repo and have it in all your machines _(`false` by default)_

## Activity Bar

The **Bookmarks** are now presented in its own Activity Bar, giving you more free space in your Explorer bar. You will have a few extra commands available:

* Jump to a bookmark, simply clicking in the bookmark item
* Remove a bookmark, right clicking in the bookmark item
* Clear the bookmark's file, right-clickin in the file item

## Support Bookmarks

While **Bookmarks** is free and open source, if you find it useful, please consider supporting it.

I've been building **Bookmarks** since VS Code internal beta days, and while I enjoy developing it, I would like to be able to give more attention to its growth.
