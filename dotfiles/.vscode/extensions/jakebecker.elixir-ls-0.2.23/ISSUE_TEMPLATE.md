### Is this the right repo?

Most of the functionality for this extension comes from ElixirLS: https://github.com/JakeBecker/elixir-ls

Please file your issue on this repo (vscode-elixir-ls) only if it has something to do with VS Code specifically and would not apply to other IDEs running ElixirLS. Otherwise, file it here: https://github.com/JakeBecker/elixir-ls/issues

If the language server fails to launch, the problem is most likely in ElixirLS, so please file the issue on that repo.
